					<blockquote>Beth makes absolutely beautiful cakes and cupcakes and, best of all, they are delicious too! I have enjoyed them at several celebrations, including my daughter's first birthday party. If you are looking for something special and yummy, Ladybug-Cakes is the place to go. It's also a safe place for your friends and families with food allergies and sensitivities! It was great to see many of my friends and families who haven't been able to enjoy dessert in quite able to eat and enjoy these cakes without worry!

					<blockquote>Delicious! I tried the vanilla cupcake with strawberry frosting and liked it better than traditional cupcakes with dairy and eggs. Plus, they were beautiful. I'm looking forward to trying the other flavors, and please keep me posted on the gluten-free!

					<blockquote>That was the best chocolate cake I have ever had. MMMMM! Loved it. and the coconut was spectacular too! Great job.

					<blockquote>I have always looked forward to FINALLY being able to eat a cupcake when you have a party. Since I am unable to eat eggs or milk or even carrots(to name just a few of the items) that so many people put in cakes (carrot cakes) you have always been so careful to not include these items. And we know that the soy and nuts are out for another special person in our family ---- Your cupcakes have been moist and fabulous and I was amazed when you added the gluten free to the mix of that, wow how versatile. And people would never know these were anything but a truly delicious regular and moist cupcake. You are talented and special

					<blockquote>Those cookie dough ones were to die for!!! It was like I was eating real cookie dough! Not cookie dough flavored frosting.

					<blockquote>I can't believe the cupcakes are vegan. Best cupcakes I've ever had!
